# Notes

## Project Structure
Module -> Package -> Files

Functions operate at the package level scope.

There is obviously still local scope for functions.

A capitalized function name is similar to how "Public" works in java. lowercase is similar to how "private" works in java.

## Build / Run
Example
`go build tutorial_1/main.go` + `./main`
or
`go run tutorial_1/main.go`
