## Introduction

The card game **Mighty** is said to have been invented by Korean college students in the mid 1970's, but it is closely related to the group of Japanese [picture capturing games](./), especially [Napoleon](napoleon.html), which date back to the beginning of the 20th century. Mighty is played mostly by current or former students in Korea, and it is known there by the English sounding name “Mighty”. It is also played by some groups in North America.

Some of the Korean vocabulary of Mighty uses political terms and words borrowed from *Napoleon*. For example, the declarer is **주공** (“president” or “party leader”). The declarer’s team is **여당** (ruling party), defenders are **야당** (opposition party), a bid is called **공약** (pledge), and the bidding phase is **선거** (election). This political theme likely refers to the military junta era during Korea’s Third Republic.

Mighty is a [point-trick game](../class/trick.html#point) with bidding. In each hand the high bidder chooses a partner by calling a card, and these two players try to take enough scoring cards (A, K, Q, J, 10) to fulfill the bid. The five-player game is described first, followed by versions for [other numbers of players](#other-numbers). Many [variations](#variations) exist.

## Players and cards

The basic game is played by five players using a standard 52-card deck plus one joker (53 cards total).

Card ranking (high → low):

**A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2**

Each **A, K, Q, J, 10** is worth **1 point**, for **20 total points** in the deck.

### Special cards

- **Mighty**
    - ♠A unless spades are trumps, then ♦A
    - Highest card in the game

- **Joker**
    - Second highest
    - Loses power if the Ripper is led

- **Ripper (Joker Hunter)**
    - ♣3 unless clubs are trumps, then ♠3
    - Can force the Joker to be played and remove its power

The Mighty and Joker together are called the **Magic Cards**.

Play proceeds clockwise.

## Deal

The first dealer is chosen randomly. Thereafter, the declarer’s partner deals the next hand. If the declarer played alone, the declarer deals.

Each player receives **10 cards**, and **3 cards** are dealt face-down to the **kitty** (blind).  
Typical dealing pattern: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 cards per player.

## Bidding

The dealer opens bidding in the first hand; thereafter, the previous declarer opens.

- Minimum bid: **13**
- Maximum bid: **20**
- Bids specify:
    - Points
    - Trump suit or **no-trump**

Examples:
- 13 hearts
- 14 no-trump
- 16 spades
- 20 clubs

Rules:
- Higher points beat lower points
- No-trump beats the same point value with a suit
- No ranking among suits
- Passing is final

The last remaining bidder becomes the **declarer**, and their bid is the **contract**.

### Redeal

If all five players pass, the cards are redealt.

A redeal may also be demanded if a player’s hand totals **½ point or less**, calculated as:

| Card | Value |
|-----|------|
| Mighty (default ♠A) | 0 |
| Joker | -1 |
| A, K, Q, J (except Mighty) | +1 |
| 10 | +½ |
| 2–9 | 0 |

## Exchanging cards and calling a partner

The declarer:
1. Picks up the **3-card kitty**
2. Discards **3 cards**
3. May score points from discarded scoring cards

The declarer may raise the bid and/or change trump according to defined rules.

### Choosing a partner

Options:
- **Call a card** (any card, including Mighty or Joker)
- **Winner of first trick**
- **No friend** (play alone, doubled score)

If the bid is **20 no-trump**, the declarer may also request a specific lead from the partner.

## The Play

- Declarer leads the first trick
- No trump lead on trick one unless holding only trumps
- Players must follow suit when possible

Trick priority:
1. Mighty
2. Joker (unless neutralized)
3. Highest trump
4. Highest card of led suit

### Joker and Ripper rules

- Joker can be played anytime
- Ripper may force Joker to be played (except first trick)
- Joker loses power when ripped

## Scoring

Scores always sum to **zero**.

Let:
- **B** = bid
- **P** = points taken
- **M** = minimum bid (13)

### Success
S = 2 × (B − M) + (P − B)

### Failure
S = B − P


Payments:
- Declarer: ±2S
- Partner: ±S
- Each opponent: ∓S

### Doubles apply if:
- Run (20 points)
- Back run (defenders ≥11 points)
- No-trump
- No friend

### Examples

- **15♦, take 16** → S = 5
- **16 NT, take 18** → S = 16
- **17♥, take 20** → S = 22

## Other numbers of players

Variants exist for **3–8 players**, adjusting:
- Deck size
- Partnerships
- Minimum bids
- Scoring

(Details preserved from original text.)

## Variations

Mighty has many evolving variants covering:
- Bidding rules
- Redeal conditions
- Partner selection
- Joker behavior
- Alternative scoring systems

### Scoring variants

Common alternatives:
- `P − 10`
- `P − M`
- `P − M + 1`

Additional doubles may apply for:
- No trump
- Burying Mighty/Joker
- No friend
- Run or back run

Doubles may be cumulative.
